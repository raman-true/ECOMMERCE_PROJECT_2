### ‚úÖ New Functions
- `is_admin()` - Check admin status
- `promote_user_to_admin()` - Make users admin
- Auto-create email preferences for new users

### ‚úÖ Admin Access
- support@abor-tech.com has full platform access
- Can edit ANY product, category, department

## üß™ Test Your Setup

### Test 1: Admin Login
1. Log in with: support@abor-tech.com
2. Go to admin dashboard
3. Try editing any product (should work!)

### Test 2: Check New Fields
Run in SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check products table has installation fields
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'products'
AND column_name LIKE '%installation%';

-- Check seller_settings has pickup fields
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'seller_settings'
AND column_name LIKE '%pickup%';
```

### Test 3: Check Email Tables
```sql
-- Check email tables exist
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('email_notification_preferences', 'email_notification_log');
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" error
- Make sure you're logged in as a Supabase admin
- Check you're in the correct project

### "Function already exists" error
- This is OK! It means the migration ran partially before
- The migration is safe to run multiple times

### "User not found" when promoting
- Make sure you created the user first (Step 4)
- Check spelling of email address
- Verify user exists in Authentication ‚Üí Users

### Admin user can't edit products
- Verify role is set to 'admin' (run Step 6 verification)
- Log out and log back in
- Check browser console for errors

## üìû Need Help?

If something goes wrong:

1. **Check Supabase Logs**
   - Go to Logs section in dashboard
   - Look for error messages

2. **Re-run Migration**
   - The migration is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
   - It won't duplicate data

3. **Manual Verification**
   - Use the test queries above
   - Check table structure in Table Editor

## üéØ Quick Command Reference

```sql

SELECT promote_user_to_admin('support@abor-tech.com');

-- Check if user is admin
SELECT is_admin(); -- (must be logged in as that user)

-- Verify admin user
SELECT email, role FROM auth.users
JOIN user_profiles ON auth.users.id = user_profiles.id
WHERE email = 'support@abor-tech.com';

-- List all new tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name LIKE '%email%';
```
