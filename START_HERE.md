## 🧪 Test Your Database

After applying migration, run these tests:

### Test 1: Verify Tables Created
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('email_notification_preferences', 'email_notification_log');
```

### Test 2: Check Product Columns
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'products'
AND column_name LIKE '%installation%';
```

### Test 3: Verify Admin User
```sql
SELECT u.email, up.role
FROM auth.users u
JOIN user_profiles up ON u.id = up.id
WHERE u.email = 'support@abor-tech.com';
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Migration is Idempotent**
   - Safe to run multiple times
   - Won't duplicate data
   - Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` checks

2. **Test Before Production**
   - Apply to development first
   - Run all test queries
   - Verify admin access works

3. **TypeScript Types Updated**
   - All types in `src/types/index.ts`
   - Already matches new schema
   - No additional type work needed

4. **Performance Optimized**
   - 5 indexes added for fast queries
   - Delivery method, installation, emails
   - Ready for production load

## 🆘 Need Help?

### If Migration Fails
1. Check Supabase logs
2. Verify you're project admin
3. Try running sections separately

### If Admin Doesn't Work
1. Verify user exists (Step 2)
2. Run promote function again (Step 3)
3. Log out and log back in

### If Types Don't Match
- TypeScript types are already updated
- Restart your dev server
- Check `src/types/index.ts`

### For More Help
- Read `DATABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- Run queries in `TEST_DATABASE_QUERIES.sql`
- Check Supabase logs in dashboard
