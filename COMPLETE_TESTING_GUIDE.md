## 8. Database Verification

### Key Verification Queries

**Check All Seller Applications:**
```sql
SELECT
  sa.business_name,
  sa.status,
  up.first_name || ' ' || up.last_name as applicant,
  up.role as current_role,
  sa.created_at
FROM seller_applications sa
JOIN user_profiles up ON sa.user_id = up.id
ORDER BY sa.created_at DESC;
```

**Check Seller Settings:**
```sql
SELECT
  ss.seller_id,
  up.first_name || ' ' || up.last_name as seller_name,
  ss.fulfillment_method,
  ss.delivery_sla_days,
  ss.pickup_enabled
FROM seller_settings ss
JOIN user_profiles up ON ss.seller_id = up.id;
```

**Check Products by Seller:**
```sql
SELECT
  p.name,
  p.price,
  p.stock,
  CASE
    WHEN p.seller_id IS NULL THEN 'Admin'
    ELSE up.first_name || ' ' || up.last_name
  END as created_by,
  up.role
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON p.seller_id = up.id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

**Check Password Reset Tokens:**
```sql
SELECT
  prt.id,
  u.email,
  prt.expires_at,
  prt.used,
  prt.created_at
FROM password_reset_tokens prt
JOIN auth.users u ON prt.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY prt.created_at DESC;
```

**Check Email Logs:**
```sql
SELECT
  recipient_email,
  email_type,
  status,
  created_at
FROM email_notification_log
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: "Application not found" when approving

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check application exists
SELECT * FROM seller_applications
WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Verify RLS allows admin to see it
```

---

#### Issue 2: Seller can't access dashboard after approval

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Manually verify role
SELECT id, role FROM user_profiles
WHERE email = 'seller@example.com';

-- If not 'seller', update:
UPDATE user_profiles
SET role = 'seller'
WHERE email = 'seller@example.com';
```

---

#### Issue 3: Password reset email not received

**Solutions:**
1. Check spam folder
2. Verify email in Supabase Auth dashboard
3. Check Supabase ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Email Templates
4. Try different email provider (Gmail, Outlook)

**Debug:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM email_notification_log
WHERE email_type = 'password_reset'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

#### Issue 4: Tables not created

**Solution:**
1. Re-run `new-sql-setup.sql`
2. Check for SQL errors in output
3. Verify schema is 'public'
4. Check Supabase project permissions

---

#### Issue 5: RLS infinite recursion

**This is FIXED** in the new migration by using `is_admin()` helper function with `SECURITY DEFINER`

If still occurs:
```sql
-- Verify function exists
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname = 'is_admin';

-- Should return: is_admin
```
