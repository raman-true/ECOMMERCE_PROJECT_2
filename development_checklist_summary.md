In summary, we have a solid foundation for the frontend UI with a well-structured component library and a cohesive design. The core homepage elements are in place, and the cart functionality is partially implemented as a modal. However, significant work remains on backend integration (Supabase), full page implementations (Shop, Product Detail, Checkout, Account, Admin), and advanced features like search, filtering, payments, and testing.
